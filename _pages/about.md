My name is Fabrice Kurmann and I am currently an undergraduate at the University of California, Santa Cruz, majoring in Computer Science and Bioinformatics. My main interests lie in applications of machine learning, deep learning, modeling, and simulation applied to biological areas including genomics, medicine, and tissue engineering. Some notable academic and research projects are on display in the corresponding sections. 

I'll be starting my graduate degree at UCSC in Fall 2024. My ultimate goal is completing a Ph.D. at the apex of CS and Biology. 

Besides my academic interests, I am also an avid triathlete, cook, baker, pianist, and motoring enthusiast. I've linked a few of my projects relating to these hobbies here just for fun.
