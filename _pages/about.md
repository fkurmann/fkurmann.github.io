My name is Fabrice Kurmann and I'm a master's student at the University of California, Santa Cruz, majoring in Computer Science. My main interests lie in applications of machine learning, deep learning, modeling, and simulation applied to biological areas including genomics, medicine, and tissue engineering. I completed my undergraduate, where I double majored in Computer Science and Bioinformatics at UC Santa Cruz in June 2024. Some notable academic and research projects are on display in the corresponding sections. 

Besides my academic interests, I am also an avid triathlete, cook, baker, pianist, and motoring enthusiast. I've linked a few of my projects relating to these hobbies here just for fun.
