My name is Fabrice Kurmann and I am currently an undergraduate at the University of California, Santa Cruz, majoring in Computer Science and Bioinformatics. My main interests lie in applications of machine learning, deep learning, modeling, and simulation applied to biological areas including genomics, medicine, and tissue engineering. Some notable academic and research projects are on display in the corresponding sections. 

I'm currently applying to multiple graduate programs with the goal of pursuing a Ph.D. at the apex of CS and Biology. I'll know a lot more about where I may end up pursuing my graduate degree by April, 2024.

Besides my academic interests, I am also an avid triathlete, cook, baker, pianist, and petrolhead. I've linked a few of my projects relating to these hobbies here just for fun.
