I'm currently working on a research project focusing on AI based shark identification with UCSC's LINQS Lab and Stanford's Block Lab. Updates on the project will appear here. Following the completion of my undergraduate studies where I wrote a senior thesis on the research conducted so far, I will be continuing work on the project into my master's studies.

### Timeline:
- December 2023: Begin of resarch collaboration.

- June 2023: Completion of my senior thesis. [Link](https://github.com/fkurmann/fkurmann.github.io/blob/master/assets/documents/Shark_Identification_Senior_Thesis.pdf) to the associated post.
